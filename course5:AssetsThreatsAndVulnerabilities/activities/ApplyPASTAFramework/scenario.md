You’re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes.

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.

## Stage 1

Description: Our application should seamlessly connect sellers and shoppers. It should be easy for users to sign-up, log in, and manage their accounts. Data privacy is a big concern for us. We want users to feel confident that we’re being responsible with their information.

Buyers should be able to directly message sellers with questions. They should also have the ability to rate sellers to encourage good service. Sales should be clear and quick to process. Users should have several payment options for a smooth checkout process. Proper payment handling is really important because we want to avoid legal issues.

## Stage 2

These are some of the technologies that it uses:

- Application programming interface (API): An API is a set of rules that define how software components interact with each other. In application development, third-party APIs are commonly used to add functionality without having to program it from scratch.

- Public key infrastructure (PKI): PKI is an encryption framework that secures the exchange of online information. The mobile app uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms: AES and RSA. AES encryption is used to encrypt sensitive data, such as credit card information. RSA encryption is used to exchange keys between the app and a user's device.

- SHA-256: SHA-256 is a commonly used hash function that takes an input of any length and produces a digest of 256 bits. The sneaker app will use SHA-256 to protect sensitive user data, like passwords and credit card numbers.

- Structured query language (SQL): SQL is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. For example, the mobile app uses SQL to store information about the sneakers that are for sale, as well as the sellers who are selling them. It also uses SQL to access that data during a purchase.

## Stage 4

Stage IV is about identifying potential threats to the application. This includes threats to the technologies you listed in Stage II. It also concerns the processes of your data flow diagram from Stage III.

For example, the apps authentication system could be attacked with a virus. Authentication could also be attacked if a threat actor social engineers an employ

## Stage 5

Stage V of PASTA is the vulnerability analysis. Here, you need to consider the attack surface of the technologies listed in Stage II.

For example, the app will use a payment system. The form used to collect credit card information might be vulnerable if it fails to encrypt data.

## Stage 7

PASTA threat modeling is commonly used to reduce the likelihood of security risks. In Stage VII, the final goal is to implement defenses and safeguards that mitigate threats.
