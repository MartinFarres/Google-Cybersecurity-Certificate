## Module 1: Introduction to Asset Security

### Understanding Risk, Threats, and Vulnerabilities in Security

Clear communication and coordination are essential during security events, especially when addressing risks to organizational assets. Three foundational terms—**risk**, **threat**, and **vulnerability**—have specific meanings in cybersecurity and are critical to planning and response.

- **Risk** is anything that could impact the **confidentiality, integrity, or availability** of an asset. It’s often calculated as:

  ```
  Risk = Likelihood × Impact
  ```

  Organizations assess risk differently based on their unique assets and priorities. Managing risk helps prevent disruption, guide improvements, and prioritize critical systems.

- **Threats** are potential events or actions that could negatively affect assets. These can be:

  - **Intentional** (e.g., a hacker exploiting a system)
  - **Unintentional** (e.g., an employee accidentally letting in an unauthorized person)

- **Vulnerabilities** are weaknesses that threats can exploit. These fall into:

  - **Technical** (e.g., misconfigured software)
  - **Human** (e.g., lost access cards)

Ultimately, **risk exists when a threat can exploit a vulnerability**. Security professionals focus on reducing the **likelihood** of threats materializing by addressing both human and technical weaknesses.

### Asset Clasification

**Asset management** is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. The idea behind this process is simple: you can only protect what you know you have.

**Asset classification** is the practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization. Determining each of those two factors varies, but the sensitivity and importance of an asset typically requires knowing the following:

- What you have

- Where it is

- Who owns it, and

- How important it is

The most common classification scheme is: restricted, confidential, internal-only, and public.

- **Restricted** is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, like need-to-know information.

- **Confidential** refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.

- **Internal-only** describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.

- **Public** is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.

### Digital and physical assets

Data can exist in three states:

- **in use:** This refers to data that is actively being accessed or processed by one or more users.

- **in transit:** This is data that is traveling from one location to another, such as when you send an email or transfer files over the internet.

- **at rest:**This describes data that is not currently being accessed or processed. It is typically stored on a physical device, such as a hard drive or cloud storage.

### Risk and Asset Security

Type of risk categories:

- Damage
- Disclosure
- Loss of Information

A Security plan is form by:

- **Policies**: A set of rules that reduce risk and protect information. They provide guidance on what is being protected and why, focusing on the strategic aspects of security.
- **Standars**: Tactical references that inform how to implement policies. They create benchmarks for security practices, such as specifying password requirements.
- **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions for performing specific security tasks. They ensure consistency and accountability in executing security measures across the organization

**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, adn best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Its compose by:

- **Core**: Simplified duties of a security plan. Five core functions:

1. Identify
2. Protect
3. Detect
4. Responds
5. Recover
6. Govern

These functions are commonly used as an informative reference to help organizations _identify_ their most important assets and _protect_ those assets with appropriate safeguards. The CSF core is also used to understand ways to _detect_ attacks and develop _response_ and _recovery_ plans should an attack happen.

- **Tiers**: These provide security teams with a way to measure performance across each of the five functions of the core. Goes from level 1 to 4, 4 being that a duty is being well performed.

- **Profiles**: Provide insight into the current state of a security plan. They are used to help organizations develop a baseline for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.
