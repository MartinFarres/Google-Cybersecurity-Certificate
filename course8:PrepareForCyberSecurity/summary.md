## Module 1: Protect data and communicate incidents

### **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity**

1. **Purpose**:

   - Ensure operations continue or are quickly restored after a security incident.
   - Minimize financial, reputational, and operational impact.

2. **Process (4 Steps)**:

   - **Identify assets**
   - **Determine threats**
   - **Detect potential attacks**
   - **Create business continuity and disaster recovery plans**

3. **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)**:

   - Sustains critical business functions during/after disruption.
   - Key steps:

     - Conduct business impact analysis
     - Document recovery steps
     - Form continuity team (cybersecurity, IT, HR, comms, ops)
     - Train the team using risk scenarios

4. **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**:

   - Focuses on restoring IT systems after an incident.
   - Key steps:

     - Restore software and data
     - Restore hardware
     - Identify affected applications and systems

5. **BCP vs DRP**:

   - BCP = keep business running
   - DRP = restore IT infrastructure and systems

Both plans work together to reduce downtime and enable organized recovery.

## Module 2: Escalate incidents

**Incident Escalation** is the process of identifynf a potential security incident, triaging it, and handing it off to a more experiencied team member.

### To escalate or not to escalate

**Malware infection** is an incident type that occurs when malicious software designed to disrupt a system inflitrates and organization's computers or networks.

**Unauthorized access** is an incident type that occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system or application whithout permission.

**Improper usage** is an incident type that occurs when an employee of an organization violates the organization's acceptable use policies.-> Always escalate.

#### Roles and responsibilities during escalation

- **Data owners**: is the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destry their information. Data owners hace administrative control over specific information hardware or software and are accountable for the classification, protection, accesss, and use of company data.
- **Data Controllers**: determine the procedure and purpose for processing data. It focuses on collecting the personal information of customers. Determines how that data is used, and ensures the data follows relevant security and privacy regulations.
  - **Data Processors**: reports directly to the data controller and are responsible for processing the data on behalf of the data controller.
- **Data Custodians**: Assign and remove access to software or hardware. Custodians are responsible for implementing security controls for the data they are responsible for.
- **Data Protection officers (DPOs)**: Are responsible for monitoring the internal compliance of an organizaion's data protection procedures.

### Timing

**Escalation Policy** are a set of actions that outline who should be notified when an incident alert occurs and how that incident should be handled.

## Module 3: Communicate effectively to influence stakeholders

Common type of stakeholders relevant in cybersecurity:

- Risk Managers: they identify risks and manage the response to security incidents. Also, notify the legal departament on regulatory issues that need to be address. They, also, inform the organization's public relations team.
- Chief Executive Officer (CEO): Responsible to financial and managerial decisions, they have the obligation to report to shareholders and manage operations of the company.
- Chief Financial Officer (CFO): Manage financial operations and costs of tools and strategies.
- Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): Responsible fot developing and organization's security architecture and conducting risks analysis and system audits. They are also tasks with creatign secutiry and business continuity plans.
- Operation Managers: They oversee security profesionals. They often work directly with analysts. Also generaly responsible for daily maintanance of security operations.

### Effective Communication

1. #### Get to the point

Security stakeholders have roles and responsibilities that are time sensitive and impact the business. It’s important that any communications they receive, and the actions they need to take, are clear. To get to the point in your communications, ask yourself:

- What do I want this person to know?
- Why is it important for them to know it?
- When do they need to take action?
- How do I explain the situation in a nontechnical manner?

2. #### Follow the protocols
3. #### Communicate with impact
   When you first begin your career in the cybersecurity field, you're more likely to interact with lower-level stakeholders, like operations managers or security risk managers, who are interested in the day-to-day operations, such as logging. Senior-level stakeholders might be more interested in the underlying risks, such as the potential financial burden of a security incident—as opposed to the details around logs.
   When you communicate with an operations manager, make sure you address relevant information that relates to their daily responsibilities, such as anomalies in data logs that you are escalating. Concentrating on a manager’s daily responsibilities will help you communicate the need-to-know information to that individual.

### Visual Storytelling

A visual dashboard is a way of displaying various types of data quickly in one place. Visual dashboards are useful tools that can be used to communicate stories to stakeholders about security events—especially when they involve numbers and data.

## Module 4: Engage with the cybersecurity community
